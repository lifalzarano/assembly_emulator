### ARM Assembly Emulator
=================

This site allows one to practice programming in assembly language. One simply types the code into a textfield, presses 'Run!', and the output will be shown in the console. To get started, click here: http://lifalzarano.github.io/assembly_emulator/

Note: The site is still in beta mode, but it's a highly functional beta.
